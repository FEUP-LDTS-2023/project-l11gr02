## Objective of the game
The main objective is to take the mask from the beginning of the level's map to the end without him touching forbidden obstacles. Furthermore, as a second objective,
he has to catch the maximum possible of power-ups, such as coins, points and stars.

## Features implemented
Our game consists, for now, in 3 levels. It has several characters and static features related to the map of the levels:

Besides that, Simple Tomb of the Mask was designed to have some power-ups referred in the list above, like coins, stars and points.

## Mockup

</p>

## Design patterns used
* State Pattern is used when an Object changes its behavior based on its internal state. In more detail, this design pattern is used to provide a systematic and loosely-coupled way to achieve the change of the behaviour of
  an Object based on its state through context and state implementations.
